Description: Create, read and write GEXF (Graph Exchange XML Format) graph
    files (used in Gephi and others). Using the XML package, it allows the user to
    easily build/read graph files including attributes, GEXF viz attributes (such
    as color, size, and position), network dynamics (for both edges and nodes) and
    edge weighting. Users can build/handle graphs element-by-element or massively
    through data-frames, visualize the graph on a web browser through "gexf-js" (a
    javascript library) and interact with the igraph package.
