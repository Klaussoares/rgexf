Description: This package helps manipulating GEXF (Graph Exchange XML Format) graph files (used in Gephi and others). Using the XML package, it allows the user to easily build/read graph files including attributes, GEXF viz attributes (such as color, size, and position), network dynamics (for both edges and nodes) and edge weighting. Users can build/handle graphs element-by-element or massively through data-frames, visualize the graph on a web browser through 'sigmajs' (a javascript library) and interact with the igraph package.
